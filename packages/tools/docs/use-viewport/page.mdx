## Usage

<UiCard category='warning'>
  We recommend using this hook **ONLY** for **client side** rendering. During **SSR** we don't have access to the **window** object we default to the large breakpoint values during SSR. So, the SSR output will be large as `true`.
</UiCard>

Just calling the hook on a React component will give you the current viewport being used:

```jsx live scope={{UseViewportExample}}
<>
  <UseViewportExample />
</>
```

## Large and XLarge

It's very important to understand that a screen bigger than medium will **ALWAYS** be large. Although we introduced XLarge due to some use cases that wanted to add another step after large for ultra width screens.

If you use the default viewport values in the library then:

```
- Large will be true when screen width is larger then `990px`
- XLarge will be true when screen width is large then `1440px`
 - Large will remain true in this case
```

## SSR Implications

**We recommend** to use this hook in components that **ONLY render client side**. The reason for this is because SSR doesn't have access to the **window** object which brings information about the screen size.

So, if this is used in a SSR component, the users will see a flickering as we default to **large** during SSR. For SSR components We highly suggest using CSS Media queries.

## Customize viewport values

These are the default values we use as the breakpoints size limit:

```ts
{
  small: 580,
  medium: 990,
  large: 1440
}
```
<small>The values are in pixels.</small>

If you want to customize this values in your app, you can set up your own values using the `UiViewportProvider`.

```jsx
  import { ViewportProvider } from '@uireact/tools';

  export const AppWrapper = () => {
    return (
      <ViewportProvider data={{ small: 700, medium: 1000, large: 1800 }}>
        <p>Your react app</p>
      </ViewportProvider>
    )
  }
```
